def: "Progression through the phases of the mitotic cell cycle, the most common eukaryotic cell cycle, which canonically comprises four successive phases called G1, S, G2, and M and includes replication of the genome and the subsequent segregation of chromosomes into daughter cells. In some variant cell cycles nuclear replication or nuclear division may not be followed by cell division, or G1 and G2 phases may be absent." [GOC:mah, ISBN:0815316194, Reactome:69278]
comment: Note that this term should not be confused with 'GO:0140014 ; mitotic nuclear division'. 'GO:0000278 ; mitotic cell cycle represents the entire mitotic cell cycle, while 'GO:0140014 ; mitotic nuclear division' specifically represents the actual nuclear division step of the mitotic cell cycle.

comment: Note that this term should not be used for direct annotation. When annotating eukaryotic species, mitotic or meiotic cytokinesis should always be specified for manual annotation and for prokaryotic species use 'FtsZ-dependent cytokinesis ; GO:0043093' or Cdv-dependent cytokinesis ; GO:0061639.  Also, note that cytokinesis does not necessarily result in physical separation and detachment of the two daughter cells from each other.

def: "A small, dense body one or more of which are present in the nucleus of eukaryotic cells. It is rich in RNA and protein, is not bounded by a limiting membrane, and is not seen during mitosis. Its prime function is the transcription of the nucleolar DNA into 45S ribosomal-precursor RNA, the processing of this RNA into 5.8S, 18S, and 28S components of ribosomal RNA, and the association of these components with 5S RNA and proteins synthesized outside the nucleolus. This association results in the formation of ribonucleoprotein precursors; these pass into the cytoplasm and mature into the 40S and 60S subunits of the ribosome." [ISBN:0198506732]

comment: Some anaerobic or microaerophilic organisms (e.g. Entamoeba histolytica, Giardia intestinalis and several Microsporidia species) do not have mitochondria, and contain mitochondrion-related organelles (MROs) instead, called mitosomes or hydrogenosomes, very likely derived from mitochondria. To annotate gene products located in these mitochondrial relics in species such as Entamoeba histolytica, Giardia intestinalis or others, please use GO:0032047 'mitosome' or GO:0042566 'hydrogenosome'.

In most eukaryotic species, intracellular sub-components of the cilium, such as the ciliary base and rootlet, are located near the plasma membrane. In Diplomonads such as Giardia, instead, the same ciliary parts are located further intracellularly. Also, 'cilium' may be used when axonemal structure and/or motility are unknown, or when axonemal structure is unusual. For all other cases, please refer to children of 'cilium'. Finally, note that any role of ciliary proteins in sensory events should be captured by annotating to relevant biological process terms.

comment: Note that this term should be used to annotate gene products in the organism undergoing the programmed cell death. To annotate genes in another organism whose products modulate programmed cell death in a host organism, consider the term 'modulation by symbiont of host programmed cell death ; GO:0052040'. Also, note that 'programmed cell death ; GO:0012501' should be used to refer to instances of caspase-independent cell death mechanisms, in the absence of further indications on the process taking place. At present, caspase-independent cell death is not yet represented in GO due to the lack of consensus and in-depth research on the topic. 'programmed cell death ; GO:0012501' may also be used to annotate gene products in taxa where apoptosis as defined in GO:0006915 does not occur, such as plants. You may also consider these specific children: GO:0097468 'programmed cell death in response to reactive oxygen species' (with descendants GO:0010421 'hydrogen peroxide-mediated programmed cell death' and GO:0010343 'singlet oxygen-mediated programmed cell death'), and GO:0009626 'plant-type hypersensitive response' and its children.

name: general transcription initiation factor activity
namespace: molecular_function
def: "A molecular function required for core promoter activity that mediates the assembly of the RNA polymerase holoenzyme at promoter DNA to form the pre-initiation complex (PIC). General transcription factors (GTFs) bind to and open promoter DNA, initiate RNA synthesis and stimulate the escape of the polymerase from the promoter. Not all subunits of the general transcription factor are necessarily present at all promoters to initiate transcription. GTFs act at each promoter, although the exact subunit composition at individual promoters may vary." [GOC:txnOH-2018]
comment: Usage guidance: The distinction between general transcription factors and DNA-binding transcription factors is that the latter modulate the selection of which genes are expressed under specific conditions, while general transcription factors are the constitutive machinery required for transcription initiation.
